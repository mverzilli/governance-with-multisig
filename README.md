# governance-with-multisig
Manage contract upgrades with a Gnosis Safe and OpenZeppelin SDK

## Environment setup

We developed this project using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/). It's not a requirement to make it work, but we do encourage using version managers as they help self documenting runtime requirements. Use the Node version specified in the `.tool-versions` file.

```
$ npm install
```
